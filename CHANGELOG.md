## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-04

**Breaking change:** complete algorithm and configuration rewrite. Existing
config entries are migrated best-effort, but reconfiguration is recommended.
Design documents: `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/STRATEGY.md`, `docs/ALGORITHM.md`.

### Changed
- Replaced the heuristic "Maximum-Based Controller" with a policy-consistent
  simulation search: every SOC-threshold candidate is simulated with the real
  switching policy over the full horizon; the cheapest (grid import − terminal
  battery value + export penalty) wins.
- Surplus loads are now scheduled by surplus allocation: only hours with
  otherwise-exported energy are assigned, validated by full-horizon
  re-simulation (a load can never cause grid import or violate the SOC
  buffer). This fixes the historic night-activation bug.
- New pure simulation core under `custom_components/battery_manager/core/`
  (no HA imports, no shared mutable state); the old
  `battery_manager/battery_manager/` library and `standalone_test/` scripts
  were removed in favour of a pytest suite (`tests/`).
- Forecast horizon now covers all provided forecast days (previously cut at
  08:00 of day 3); a terminal value makes the horizon end well-defined.
- CI now runs ruff and the pytest suite (replaces flake8/black/isort).

### Added
- Objective-based load scheduling (pass 2): loads may also run in hours
  without direct surplus (e.g. pre-charging before a short production peak)
  when the full-horizon re-simulation proves the energy comes from
  otherwise-lost surplus — grid import never increases.
- Make-before-break switching of the 24 V rail: the 48 V→24 V DC/DC converter
  is configurable as a switch; changeover runs sequenced (new supply on →
  delay → old supply off) with confirmation, abort-on-failure, background-task
  isolation (immune to replan cancellations) and idle re-sync of the real
  switch states. Distinct-entity validation and an `assumed_state` warning
  protect the guarantee.
- Multiple surplus loads as config sub-entries with priority order, parallel
  operation, per-load battery-share tolerance, energy limits (powerstation
  SOC/target), power feedback (measured W override) and availability entities;
  one recommendation entity per load.
- Household appliances as config sub-entries: detected runs add their
  remaining consumption to the forecast; optional start-window advisor entity
  ("a full run fits into the surplus right now").
- Emergency grid-support paths (24 V PSU replacing the DC/DC converter, 48 V
  fixed-power support PSU): simulated as last-resort escalation and switched
  directly by the integration; status entities included.
- Planner tuning options: SOC safety buffer, hysteresis, threshold inertia,
  minimum switch interval.
- New sensors: grid import forecast, lost surplus forecast.
- German translations (`de.json`).

### Fixed
- Entity-change listeners were never armed (`_listeners_setup` stayed False):
  input changes now trigger debounced replanning as intended, and listeners
  are properly released on unload.
