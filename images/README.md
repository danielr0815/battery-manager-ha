## Brand Files for HACS

For optimal HACS integration, you may want to add the following images:

### Recommended Images:
- `icon.png` - Integration icon (512x512px, PNG format)
- `logo.png` - Project logo (any reasonable size)
- `screenshot_config.png` - Configuration UI screenshot
- `screenshot_entities.png` - Entities dashboard screenshot

### Brand Guidelines:
- Use consistent color scheme (blue/green for battery/energy themes)
- Ensure icons are readable at small sizes
- Follow Home Assistant design language where possible
- Use PNG format with transparency for icons

### HACS Integration:
HACS will automatically use `icon.png` if present in this directory for the integration listing.
